<p>Limbo is a horror narrative game that tells a story through no words. Feelings and fears are sparked inside the player by the use of images and sound effects alone. These
  tools can be very effective in creating apprehension and expectation. The visual and aural elements cooperate with each other to amplify the effects intended.
  
  <p>A shocking moment for me near the beginning of Limbo was the dismemberment and killing of the Giant Spider.</p>

<p>Example 1: Boy pulls leg off of spider</p>
<center><IMG SRC="https://portforward.com/games/walkthroughs/Limbo/limbo-139-small.webp"></center>

<p>In the beginning of the game, the boy is powerless and helpless, a target of nature. He gets killed by bear traps, spiders, and spikes, and has no way to defend himself.
Unlike other games which have buttons to attack, block, dodge, etc, the boy can only survive by jumping and through wit. Therefore, I was very shocked by the moment in the game
where the player gets to fight back. At one point of the game, the player can approach the wounded spider. The only way to solve the puzzle is to rip its arms off and toss the carcass
in the spikes. I was horrified, grossed out, and shocked. The boy switched from completely helpless, to capable of a gruesome killing. I think the way Freud describes fright exemplifies
my feelings. He writes, "'Fright', however, is the name we give to the state a person gets into when he has run into danger without being prepared for it; it emphasizes the factor of 
surprise" (Freud Beyond the Pleasure Principle 144). The shock of the spider approaching us gives us fright, and the shock of the realization of our gruesome solution also gives us fright.</p>

 <p>Digging deeper, we can investigate the aural effects used to create these sensations. For example, there is a present heartbeat when the boy approaches the spider.
   I have equalized the audio to target the beating frequencies: take a listen. </p>

  <p> We can see this in a Sonic Visualizer as well. <p>

    <p> There is a visible, extremely low lurching sound at the bottom of the frequency analysis. This might be loud enough to be hear consciously, or because it is so low it might be
      something that is mostly felt. Our brains relate low noises to large things, such as a creature's footsteps or something large thudding to the ground. Another aspect of low frequencies
      is that they sound like they are behind us, due to the shape of the ear and the doppler effect, and our lifelong experiences of interpreting those low tones as behind us.
      
      I think it is very significant that the developers thought to include this effect. It would have cost nothing to leave it out. Instead, an effort was made to add a heartbeat noise
      when the boy is near the spider, putting us in his shoes, as if we are right next to an enormous creature as well. This element does not advance the story or plot. Hearing the heartbeat
      does not offer any new information or anything novel: we are already well aware that the spider is a living creature. Therefore, in contrast to an element that would be considered "predictive", 
      the noises are instead "descriptive", according to Roland Barthes idea of the "reality effect". <font color="green">See Barthes, Roland. "The Reality Effect" in <i>The Rustle of Language</i> Richard Howard (Berkeley, CA: UC Press, 1984 (1968).</font>
      <font color="purple">According to the "reality effect", narrative elements are either predictive or descriptive. Predictive elements move the plot forward, such as the crates or the maggots
        in Limbo. Descriptive elements exist purely to solidify the believability of the created world. In terms of video games, these could be furniture in a house, backgrounds or skybox textures, 
        and uncollectable physics items. I argue that in this scenario, the spider's heartbeat acts as a descriptive element, purely adding more reality to the scene.</font>
