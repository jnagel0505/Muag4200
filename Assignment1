<p>A shocking moment for me near the beginning of Limbo was the dismemberment and killing of the Giant Spider.</p>

<p>Example 1: Boy pulls leg off of spider</p>
<p><IMG SRC="https://portforward.com/games/walkthroughs/Limbo/limbo-139-small.webp"></p>

<p>In the beginning of the game, the boy is powerless and helpless, a target of nature. He gets killed by bear traps, spiders, and spikes, and has no way to defend himself.
Unlike other games which have buttons to attack, block, dodge, etc, the boy can only survive by jumping and through wit. Therefore, I was very shocked by the moment in the game
where the player gets to fight back. At one point of the game, the player can approach the wounded spider. The only way to solve the puzzle is to rip its arms off and toss the carcass
in the spikes. I was horrified, grossed out, and shocked. The boy switched from completely helpless, to capable of a gruesome killing. I think the way Freud describes fright exemplifies
my feelings. He writes, "'Fright', however, is the name we give to the state a person gets into when he has run into danger without being prepared for it; it emphasizes the factor of 
surprise" (Freud Beyond the Pleasure Principle 144). The shock of the spider approaching us gives us fright, and the shock of the realization of our gruesome solution also gives us fright.(</p>
